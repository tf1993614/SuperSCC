# SuperSCC

SuperSCC (Super single cell clustering), a novel algorithm that utilizes machine-learning models to discover cell identities and gene modules from multiple datasets without the need of data integration. Of note, SuperSCC can be implemented both in cell lineage and cell state level, thereby building the hierarchy of cell programs with specific cell identity and gene modules. Such information has the great potential to identify the shared rare populations across datasets regardless of batch effect and benefits label transfer for mapping cell labels from reference to query.
